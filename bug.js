In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using the `app` directory structure with server components and a complex data fetching mechanism.  The issue manifests as a seemingly random failure to hydrate components, resulting in an unhandled promise rejection or a blank screen. This is often not caught by standard error boundaries. The problem stems from an asynchronous data fetching operation within a server component that doesn't properly handle errors or race conditions. If a data fetch fails or is significantly delayed, it can lead to a mismatch between the server-rendered content and the client-side hydration process, ultimately causing the app to crash.
